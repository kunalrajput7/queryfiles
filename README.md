# üìÑ QueryFile ‚Äì AI-Powered Document Assistant

**QueryFile** is a full-stack web application that enables users to upload PDF documents and interact with them through a chat-based AI interface.  
It extracts information from PDFs, supports semantic search, and provides an intuitive experience for document analysis and Q&A.

## üöÄ Project Overview

QueryFile combines a **FastAPI backend** and a **Next.js (React) frontend** to deliver an **AI-powered PDF assistant**.  
The system supports **OCR-based text extraction, RAG-based semantic search, and LLM-powered Q&A**, making it ideal for quickly understanding, querying, and summarizing large documents (up to 30MB).

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend (`/backend`)

- **Framework & Language**: Python with **FastAPI**.  
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - Handle **PDF uploads** from frontend.  
  - Extract text from PDFs (via **PyPDF2**, **unstructured**, OCR for scanned PDFs).  
  - Integrate with **Mistral-7B LLM** (via LangChain) for document Q&A.  
  - Use **Sentence Transformers** + **FAISS** for semantic vector search.  
  - Store and retrieve files in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.  
  - Manage **multi-threaded uploads**, handling 15+ concurrent documents.  
  - Serve APIs behind **Nginx reverse proxy** for reliability.  
- **Deployment**:
  - Containerized with **Docker**.  
  - Deployed on **Google Cloud T4 GPU VM** for scalable RAG inference.  
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `requirements.txt`.

## üé® Frontend (`/frontend`)

- **Framework**: **Next.js** (React) with Vite for fast builds.  
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - **User-friendly UI** for uploading PDFs and chatting with AI.  
  - Authentication (login/signup) via **Firebase**.  
  - Display of chat responses, previews, and user interactions.  
  - Navigation with components like **Navbar**, **Sidebar**, and **MainPage**.  
  - Communication with backend via `axios`.  
- **Deployment**: Configured and deployed via **Vercel**.  

---

## üîê Authentication

- **Firebase Authentication** for user login, registration, and session management.  
- Key Components:  
  - `Login.jsx`  
  - `Signup.jsx`  
  - `AuthPage.jsx`  

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Integration

- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Secure storage for uploaded PDFs.  
- **Google Cloud VM (T4 GPU)**: Hosts the backend, optimized for vector search + LLM inference.  
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Manages routing, scalability, and fault tolerance.  

---

## ü§ñ AI & Document Processing

- **LLM Integration**: Uses **Mistral-7B** (via LangChain) for natural language querying over PDFs.  
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines **Sentence Transformers embeddings + FAISS** for semantic search.  
- **PDF Processing**: Extract text with **PyPDF2** and **unstructured**, including OCR for scanned documents.  

---

## üö¢ Deployment

- **Backend**:  
  - Dockerized FastAPI app with Nginx proxy.  
  - Deployed on **Google Cloud T4 GPU VM** for high-performance inference.  

- **Frontend**:  
  - Next.js React app deployed on **Vercel**.

## üìë Typical User Flow

1. User visits QueryFile web app.  
2. Registers or logs in via **Firebase Authentication**.  
3. Uploads a PDF document (up to 30MB).  
4. Asks questions in the **chat interface**.  
5. Backend processes document via OCR + RAG pipeline.  
6. AI generates answers based on semantic search + context retrieval.  
7. User can continue querying, view, or download results.

## üìå Summary

**QueryFile** is a **cloud-deployed, AI-powered document analysis platform**.  
It integrates:  
- A **Dockerized FastAPI backend** with Nginx proxy,  
- A **Next.js frontend** for user experience,  
- **Firebase** for authentication,  
- **Google Cloud (T4 GPU + GCS)** for scalable storage & inference,  
- A **RAG pipeline** with **Mistral-7B, Sentence Transformers, and FAISS** for semantic search.  

This project demonstrates an end-to-end, production-ready pipeline for **chat-based document analysis**, with strong focus on **scalability, performance, and user experience**.
